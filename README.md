# ML_coursework_dementia
Group project for [Machine Learning in Python (MATH11205)](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/23-24/dpt/cxmath11205.htm) course. 

Analysed a dataset of over 400,000 patient demographic information data to train and evaluate ML models for identifying dementia risk factors. This is significant in the real-world because dementia is a common disease among the aged population and incurs substantial public health costs, and its pathology is unknown (there is hypothesis). Early diagnosis and intervention are critical, making it important to identify at-risk populations.
